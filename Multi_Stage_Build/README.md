### Multi-Stage Dockerfile Explanation

The Dockerfile for this application utilizes a multi-stage build approach to create a more efficient and optimized container image. This technique helps in reducing the final image size and improving security by separating the build and runtime environments.

### Summary

- **Stage 1 (Builder Stage):**
  - In this initial stage, the Dockerfile uses the official **Python 3.9** image to create a dedicated build environment. This environment is configured to install all necessary dependencies required by the application.
  - A virtual environment is created to isolate the dependencies, ensuring that the application runs with the correct versions of libraries without conflicting with other Python projects.
  - The application's source code files are copied into the container, allowing the build process to access all necessary files to complete the installation of dependencies.

- **Stage 2 (Final Stage):**
  - The second stage utilizes a slimmer version of the Python 3.9 image, specifically designed for running applications in production environments. This reduces the overall image size by excluding unnecessary build tools and files.
  - The previously built virtual environment and application files are copied from the builder stage to the final stage. This ensures that only the essential components are included in the final image.
  - Port **5000** is exposed, allowing external access to the application when it runs in the container. The command to launch the Flask application is defined, which activates the server and begins serving requests.

By leveraging a multi-stage Dockerfile structure, this setup enables the creation of smaller, more secure, and faster-to-deploy images. This approach minimizes the attack surface and optimizes the container's performance.
